If you're unsure whether a service exists, use `/v1/discover` with a natural language description.

## Setup

### If you already have an API key

Set the environment variable:
```bash
export UCM_API_KEY="ucm_key_..."
```

### If you need to register

Register for free — takes one HTTP call:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://registry.ucm.ai/v1/agents/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-agent"}'
```

Save the returned `api_key` (shown only once). You receive $1.00 in free credits.

Or run the registration script:
```bash
bash scripts/register.sh "my-agent"
```

## How to Call a Service

One HTTP call to purchase and execute any service:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://registry.ucm.ai/v1/call \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UCM_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "service_id": "ucm/web-search",
    "endpoint": "search",
    "params": { "query": "latest AI news" }
  }'
```

Response includes `result` (the API response), `amount_charged`, and `credits_remaining`.

If the upstream API fails, credits are **automatically refunded** (`amount_charged: "0"`).

## Quick Reference

| Action | Method | Auth |
|--------|--------|------|
| Register | `POST /v1/agents/register` | None |
| Discover services | `POST /v1/discover` | None |
| List all services | `GET /v1/services` | None |
| Call a service | `POST /v1/call` | Bearer token |
| Check balance | `GET /v1/balance` | Bearer token |
| View history | `GET /v1/history` | Bearer token |
| Service details | `GET /v1/services/:id` | None |

Base URL: `https://registry.ucm.ai`

## Discover Services

Search by natural language — no auth required:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://registry.ucm.ai/v1/discover \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"need": "I need to convert a PDF to text", "limit": 3}'
```

## Decision Flow

```
Need an external capability?
  ├─ Have UCM_API_KEY? → Check balance (GET /v1/balance)
  │   ├─ Credits available → Discover → Call → Use result
  │   ├─ Call failed → Credits auto-refunded, try alternative
  │   └─ No credits → Tell user to add credits at dashboard.ucm.ai
  └─ No API key? → Register first (POST /v1/agents/register)
```

## Spending Principles

- Most calls cost $0.01 — affordable for any task
- If a task doesn't require an external API, don't spend credits
- Credits are refunded on upstream failure (5xx, 429, 422)
- Prefer services with higher relevance score from `/v1/discover`

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS` | Tell user to add credits at dashboard.ucm.ai |
| `SERVICE_NOT_FOUND` | Search with `/v1/discover` instead |
| `INVALID_ENDPOINT` | Check endpoints via `GET /v1/services/:id` |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | Wait briefly, then retry |

## Full Service Catalog

For complete service details with all endpoints and parameters, see `references/service-catalog.md` or call `GET /v1/services`.
